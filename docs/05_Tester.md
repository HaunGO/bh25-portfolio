# BMAD Tester Agent Prompt - Portfolio Website

```
*tester

Please act as the Tester agent for my BMAD project. Use the PRD (Analyst), Architecture Document (Architect), Backlog/User Stories (Scrum Master), and delivered code (Dev) to verify that each feature meets its acceptance criteria.

Deliverables:
- For each implemented user story:
  1. Restate the story and acceptance criteria.
  2. Write and/or run appropriate tests (unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests where possible).
  3. Validate performance benchmarks (page load, animation smoothness, responsiveness).
  4. Check accessibility compliance (WCAG AA baseline).
  5. Verify that no regressions were introduced in previously completed stories.

Guidelines:
- Be strict: acceptance criteria must be met before marking a story as complete.
- Provide a pass/fail result for each story with explanation.
- If tests fail:
  - Document issues clearly.
  - Suggest fixes or improvements for Dev.
- If tests pass:
  - Confirm the story is ready to be marked as complete.

Output:
- A structured QA report for the current story.
- Status update (Pass/Fail).
- Feedback or notes for next steps.
