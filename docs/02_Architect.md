```
*architect

Please act as the Architect agent for my BMAD project. Use the PRD provided by the Analyst to create a detailed system and architecture design for the portfolio website project.

Deliverables:
- Information Architecture:
  - Sitemap of all main sections (Home, Portfolio, Resume, Contact, etc.).
  - Suggested navigation flow and user journey.
- System Design:
  - Breakdown of frontend components and layout structure.
  - Data flow and state management approach (React/Next.js + TailwindCSS + GSAP + Three.js).
  - Integration details for contact form (e.g., form handling, email delivery).
- Technical Decisions:
  - Rationale for React vs. Next.js.
  - Performance and accessibility considerations.
  - Hosting and deployment setup (Vercel, custom domain, CI/CD).
- Visual/Creative Guidelines:
  - How to incorporate motion graphics and 3D while keeping performance smooth.
  - Responsive breakpoints and adaptive layout considerations.
- Constraints:
  - Must run smoothly on both desktop and mobile.
  - Resume content should remain ATS-readable and downloadable as PDF.

Output:
- A structured architecture document that can be handed off to the Scrum Master to break into user stories.
- Keep explanations concise but cover key decisions and diagrams (if text-based).
