# BMAD Analyst Prompt - Portfolio Website

```
*analyst

I want to start a new BMAD project. Please act as the Analyst agent and create a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD).

Project Idea:
A modern, creative portfolio website that highlights my work as a Senior Frontend / Creative Developer. It should feel professional but showcase advanced motion graphics, 3D elements, and interactive storytelling.

Context & Vision:
- Target audience: recruiters and hiring managers (primary), potential clients (secondary), and other developers/designers (inspiration).
- Problem: Traditional resumes are static and uninspiring. I want a portfolio site that demonstrates my technical creativity while also making it easy for recruiters to quickly learn about me.
- Goal: Present myself as a strong candidate, showcase projects and creativity, provide an interactive resume, and enable easy contact.

Requirements:
- Core features:
  1. Home / Landing page with bold visual intro and motion graphics.
  2. Portfolio section with projects, case studies, and interactive previews.
  3. Interactive Resume (scroll-based or modular, highlighting skills and experience).
  4. Contact Form with validation and email integration.
  5. Performance & Accessibility baseline (fast load, responsive, WCAG AA compliance).
- Optional features:
  - 3D models and WebGL/Three.js scenes.
  - Advanced GSAP motion sequences (parallax, physics animations).
  - Theme toggles (dark/light or playful/professional).
  - Blog or Notes section.
  - Easter eggs / playful hidden interactions.
- Constraints:
  - Tech stack: React (or Next.js), TailwindCSS v3, GSAP, Three.js.
  - Hosting: Vercel with custom domain.
  - Must run smoothly on mobile and desktop browsers.
  - Resume content must be ATS-readable (downloadable PDF included).

Deliverables:
- Provide a clear PRD with sections for Goals, Target Users, Core Features, Optional Features, Constraints, and Success Metrics.
- Keep it structured and ready for the Architect agent next.
